Figures are an important part of any publication.
They are often the first thing readers look at and will help usually are the deciders as to whether non-specialists are going to read on...a good figure goes a long way! If you can spend the time it is well worth it (*within reason of course*).
A good read on some do and don'ts for figures by [Rougier et al. 2014 PLOS comp biol](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833), while your at it check out this one by [Mensh and Kording 2017](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619).


I don't see the need to reinvent the wheel so see some useful pages: [`ggplot2` reference](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) and this one from [STHDA](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-colors-how-to-change-colors-automatically-and-manually) and this one by [Selva Prabhakaran](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html)

One of my favourite colour palettes at the moment is [Viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html)

```{r viridis install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("viridis")
library(viridis)
```

Usage of this palette with various ggplots [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html)

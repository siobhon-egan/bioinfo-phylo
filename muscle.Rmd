### Alignments 
Make an alignment and save to a file in FASTA format:
```
  muscle -in seqs.fa -out seqs_muscle.afa
```

Write alignment to the console in CLUSTALW format (more readable than FASTA):
```
  muscle -in seqs.fa -clw
```
### Trees
Commandline muscle is very helpful for making quick trees. Depending on the depth of phylogenetics needed, a simple NJ tree maybe all you need.

Make a UPGMA tree from a multiple alignment:
```
 muscle -maketree -in seqs_muscle.afa -out seqs_muscle_tree.phy
```
Make a Neighbor-Joining tree from a multiple alignment:
```
  muscle -maketree -in seqs_muscle.afa -out seqs_muscle_tree.phy -cluster neighborjoining
```

If are a R Markdown newbie I suggest starting at the offical lessons on [R Markdown by R Studio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

[Here is a presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRpQkv2wRcJILZ69i9H9z38XukVGi94XjdkTzwlVXhbHaG4aqVn2QZ3mo01xeixsw_SgtxnOkZ299Rm/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) I have presented in the past to give you a give overview of using RMarkdown


**INSTALL**
Just like the rest of R packages, get started with R Markdown by executing the following from the console
```
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

Create a new RMarkdown document by selecting `File > New File > R Markdown... > Document > HTML > Open`
This will open the default `RMarkdown` document that will knit to html, however you can change to PDF, word etc.

# Templates

To get the most out of RMarkdown there are a number of various templates to suit whatever document and style you need. Below are some links to get you started.
